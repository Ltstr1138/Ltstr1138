- 👋 Hi, I’m @Ltstr1138
- 👀 I’m interested in drafting "the Agreement" for all humans, which will create a legal entity for all Humans ( let's called it " the Lives Inc." for now), enabling its members to contribute as much as they want, and to receive benefits as much as they deserve, and in the process, Lives Inc. will always strives for good and sustainable development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to come out with the first draft of the Agreement, and the first draft of the Action Plan to form the Lives Inc..
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on completing the first draft of the Agreement and the Action Plan, and I'd like to colloborate with all living authors whose titles were selected by Blink, and other selected philososhers and law lecturers.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
